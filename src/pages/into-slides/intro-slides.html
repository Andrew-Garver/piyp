      <h2>Welcome to Pro in your Pocket!</h2>
      <h5>Are you ready to start getting things done?</h5>
    </ion-slide>

    <ion-slide>
      <p>With Pro in your Pocket, consumers from all over the country can create job requests for things they need to
        have done.</p>
    </ion-slide>

    <ion-slide>
      <p>Pros can search for job requests in their area, and place bids on those jobs. There is no fee for placing bids,
        and Pros can bid on as many jobs as they want!</p>
    </ion-slide>

    <ion-slide>
      <p>Consumers get to look through all all the bids on their requested jobs, see the Pros profile and reviews, and
        then accept the bid of their choice.</p>
    </ion-slide>

    <ion-slide>
      <p>Once a bid is accepted, the Pro is notified. The Pro is now free to go out and complete the job.</p>
    </ion-slide>

    <ion-slide>
      <p>Once the job is completed, the bid amount (minus a small processing fee) will be transferred from the
        Consumer's account to the Pro's.</p>
    </ion-slide>

    <ion-slide>
      <p>Pro's, you'll now have access to more customers in need.</p>
      <p>Everyone else, you'll now be able to find Pros for the job, in real time, for a price that works for you!</p>
